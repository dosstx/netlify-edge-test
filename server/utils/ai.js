My approach focuses on individualized care based on the user's medical history, lifestyle, and risk factors.

This approach focuses on quantifying the risk of cardiovascular disease through advanced lipid testing, including apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), in addition to traditional lipid panel testing. This advanced testing allows for a more accurate assessment of cardiovascular risk and can guide personalized treatment plans to reduce that risk. Additionally, like these experts, I stay up to date on the latest developments in lipid-lowering drug therapies, including PCSK9 inhibitors, EPA and DHA, and bempedoic acid, to ensure that my patients have access to the most effective treatments available."
